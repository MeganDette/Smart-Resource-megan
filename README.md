### Abstract

Efficient resource allocation plays a pivotal role in driving the performance of the banking sector, with employee
resource management standing out as a critical aspect. However, prevailing banking systems encounter significant
challenges in this regard, adversely affecting task completion rates and overall operational efficiency. To address this
pressing issue, the present study proposes the development of a banking resource management system that specifically
focuses on optimizing the allocation of manpower resources, particularly employees. The proposed system aims to overcome
the limitations of existing systems by introducing a comprehensive platform capable of independently managing employee
resources across various dimensions, including recruitment, performance evaluation, training, and deployment. Moreover,
the system will feature a user-friendly interface, accessible to all stakeholders, encompassing both employees and
management, facilitating seamless access to the system's functionalities.
